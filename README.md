## Demonstrated skills in various fields.

Data cleaning involves removing duplicates, resolving missing values, and addressing mixed or incorrect data types.

Merging data successfully, exporting final pkl file as a final result after selecting and preparing data.

The exploratory analysis examined descriptive statistics, histograms, scatterplots, and bar charts to analyze data distributions and compare values for each variable.

New variables were derived by grouping data by user, order, and department, allowing exploration and analysis. Aggregated data created flags about user ordering habits and demographic information confirmed through crosstabs and value counts.
