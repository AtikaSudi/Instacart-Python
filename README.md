# Instacart Basket Analysis

Data analysis project using Python on Instacart's Grocery Basket.

## Objectives

The project's goal is to clean and combine data on orders, goods, departments, and customers in order to analyse it for insights and responses to inquiries from the marketing and sales teams. It will pinpoint the busiest hours, the days with the highest sales, and repeat clients. Inconsistencies in users' ordering behaviours based on variables like location, income, and loyalty status will also be revealed through the investigation. The study tries to discover and take into account changes in ordering behaviours by looking at customer profiles utilising different variables.

## Tools

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy

Visualisation: Seaborn, matplotlib, and Scipy

Software: Jupyter Notebooks and Excel

## Demonstrated skills in various fields.

+ Data cleaning involves removing duplicates, resolving missing values, and addressing mixed or incorrect data types.

+ Merging data successfully, exporting final pkl file as a final result after selecting and preparing data.

+ The exploratory analysis examined descriptive statistics, histograms, scatterplots, and bar charts to analyze data distributions and compare values for each variable.

+ New variables were derived by grouping data by user, order, and department, allowing exploration and analysis. Aggregated data created flags about user ordering habits and demographic information confirmed through crosstabs and value counts.
